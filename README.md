# 🧬 Cancer Detection AI

A binary classification model that predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant using clinical features from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project applies machine learning to a real-world healthcare problem — detecting breast cancer using clinical data. The notebook builds and trains a neural network using TensorFlow, with proper data preprocessing and evaluation.

## 🧪 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow (Keras)
- pandas, scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## 📊 Model & Metrics
- Model: Feedforward Neural Network (Keras)
- Optimized with: Early Stopping
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Loss Curve
- Train/Test Split: 80/20

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `CancerDetectionAI.ipynb` in Jupyter/Colab/VS Code
3. Run all cells in order
